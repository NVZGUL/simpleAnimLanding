  "readme": "# muddle\ncombine and compose connect-style middleware\n\n## installation\n\n    $ npm install muddle\n\n## sample usage\n\n`muddle` takes any number of middleware functions as arguments and aggregates them into one middleware function. Order is preserved:\n    \n    var connect = require('connect')\n    var muddle = require('muddle')\n    var middleware = muddle(\n      connect.bodyParser(),\n      connect.cookiedParser()\n    )\n    connect.use(middleware)\n\nOf course, you can use any connect-style middleware like `function (req, res, next)` - it doesn't actually have to come from the connect module!\n\nThis is useful for encapsulating logic and composing middleware.\n\n## tribute song lyrics\n\n    Well, if I remain passive and you just want to cuddle\n    Then we should be ok, and we won't get in a muddle\n    Because we're seeing other people\n    At least that's what we say we are doing\n\n- \"Seeing Other People\", Belle and Sebastian\n\n## license\nMIT.
